## About Me

Software engineer with over a decade of proven technical ability and leadership. Passionate about technology, continuing to learn and transferring that knowledge to others.

Expertise in service oriented architecture/microservices, cloud engineering and designing scalable software systems. Currently learning all I can about topics like functional programming, concurrency, distributed systems and machine learning/AI.

When I'm not in front of of a computer screen you can find me out for run or a hike, in the rock climbing gym or doing some traveling.
